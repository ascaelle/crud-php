# CONTACT_CRUD

This is a short project for learning PHP: 

+ Files inclusion
+ Database connection with PDO
+ Form handling
+ HTTP redirection with `header` function
+ CRUD operations
+ Login with PHP `$_SESSION`
+ Logout 
+ Authentication
+ Authorisation 

I also learn how to use `GIT` and `GITHUB`.
